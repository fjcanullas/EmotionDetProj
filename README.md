# EmotionDetProj

Welcome to MFTCamSystems

A full-stack application that highlights lesser known uses for cameras as well as highlighting cameras that have been widely recognized as obsolete.

This is a project where my group designs a couple of applications showcasing lesser known camera usages. 

We created an facial detection system using your laptop camera. We used python to write the code for this system.
This system would be able to connect and turn on your laptop camera upon clicking a button. Within the application a user can choose up to four different values that the program will estimate and guess depending on your facial scan. These values are your age, gender, race, and emotion. 

We also highlighted the Microsoft Kinect Version 2.0 camera. Using the Microsoft Kinect Studio v2.0 software.

For this part of our project I was able to use the Microsoft Kinect Studio software to connect and display from my Microsoft Kinect Device from my laptop.The way we set up this was to display the thermal signature of a person in infrared thermal and infrared night vision. We would also track the person as the move around the frame of the cameras sensors. I am currently working to write code to detect a persons movement without the direct use of Microsoft Kinect Studio.

We also used HTML and CSS to make a full fledged and working user interface in which a user can interact with both of our applications.
